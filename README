NginX-P is a Simple & Portable NginX server deployer.
You can use this to locally host any Webpage OR quickly test verious NginX behaviours and cases, simply by modifying the 'default.conf' file in the Config folder.
This is particularly useful for testing and comparing your own WebServer behaviour and see if it matches NginX's.
The Makefile calls 'docker compose' which creates the Docker image based on the docker-compose.yml parameters and the Dockerfile specified.
The image also includes Nano and CURL if you want to enter the container and modify/test from within.

#--------- HOW TO USE: ---------#

Simply run 'make' at the root of the repository. The Container will automatically start and attach to the Terminal you ran 'make' in.
Then go to the Browser of your choosing and go to http://localhost:8080/ to view your Homepage (depending on your configuration).


If you want to modify the config file and try again:
	Stop the hanging Terminal with a SIGINT (Ctrl + C) and run 'make clean'. This stops the container and takes down the Compose.
	Run 'make' again after modifying the config file to your liking.
	Avoid using 'fclean' or 're' because they also clear the Cache, which will make the next 'make' you run take longer.
		Use this only if you want to completely start over with no cache or if something is not working correctly.

If you want to access the Container:
	Open a new Terminal window, since this one has NginX attached to it.
	Run 'docker ps'. This will list your active containers. There should be only one: the NginX-P Container.
	Copy the Container ID on the left.
	Run 'docker exec -it <CONTAINER-ID> bash' with the Container ID you copied.
		This'll give you a Bash TTY directly executed from inside your container.
